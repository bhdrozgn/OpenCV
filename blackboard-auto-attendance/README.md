# blackboard-auto-attendance
* It is a program for Blackboard Collaborate to auto raise hands if raised hands detected in some parts of the screen.
* It can act as a attendance bot if lecturer takes attendance by raised hands
* One of the downside is you have to keep Blackboard on top or don't obstruct the locations of the screen which the program needs
* I know that it can be wrote with less code but i didn't put too much effort on this and used some codes from my other projects and rearranged them
